## Nym Service Grants 
In order to onboard users to Nym, we need more gateways and network requesters for apps that already work with Nym, like the Nym wallet, Electrum wallet, Keybase and Telegram. 

This repository contains the application form to apply for a Service Grant to operate a gateway and network requester with a pre-defined domain whitelist. 

**The use of these applications via the Nym mixnet is currently experimental, and will gather stats on usage numbers and the amount of traffic directed towards a particular application. There is no other data gathered - this is a privacy system so we simply donâ€™t have it!.**

### How to apply 
* Fork this repository
* Rename and fill in the required information in `service_grants/template.md`
* Create a PR against this repository 
* Wait to be contacted by `grant@nymtech.net` 

**All applicants will be contacted after July 27th with a decision**
