```
I have been running nym testnet since finney. I just believe that privacy is a basic born right. Nym is teh only project that really sealed the gap no one wants to talk and even let people think about. I think myself, if people get a saying about what and how their future will be shaped. Then, nym will be a fundamental layer of the internet of the future.
Gateway nodes which are the first hop into the mixnet. They provide destination for the mixnet packets.
Network Requesters are the hop out that takes the user from the exit gateway to an app.
