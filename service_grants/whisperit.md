Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
I was planning to run NYM infrastracture anyway, as I like the ideas behind the project and was a testnet participant since late 2020.
Running Gateway and Network Requester will help to attract users to NYM and to optimise the whole product. If I have to choose one service to support with my Network Requester, it will be Telegram (as, probably, the most popular one).
