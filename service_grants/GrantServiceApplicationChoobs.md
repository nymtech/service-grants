Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
We (Choobs Ltd) are a Swiss based (Geneva) IT company formed of about 15 technology enthusiasts active for 20 years as IT services provider for Banks, Airlines, Watch makers, ...
In the last few years, we have been working with blockchains (for example smart consent contracts for the Geneva hospital) and recently started to run nodes (Gnosis, ChainLINK, Nym, ...)
Due to the activity of our customers, security and privacy are two essential values when it comes to IT and more specifically data. In this sense we find the nym project extremely interesting and would like to participate as much as possible.
Currently we are running a MixNode (29Q3jp7DN1ER82DcBFXo6v6hvWpKtvnP7SEmcmPJ8E9E) on the mainnet and were already running a MixNode on the testnet.
We are prepared to run a Gateway and Network Requester for the NymWallet as a start but we could also have one for Keybase, Electrum, Telegram, or other if you require so.
Hope to hear from you soon !
