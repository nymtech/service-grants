```

Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
Gateways are the first entry to the Nym mixnet. They are a kind of gatekeepers with some mailbox functions.
The Network Requester sits on ‘other side’ of the mixnet and allows Nym users to make outgoing network requests 
for them thereby hiding metadata.

Nym was my second node testing project but my fav. I received a Tier-2 grant from the Nodes Guru team as a mixnode runner and 
I want to continue to help develop the project on my level as we all really need the real privacy and security. I would like to support Nym Wallet.
