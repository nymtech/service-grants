Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
Privacy is very important for everyone. I want to contribute as much as I can to building confidential infrastructure.
A Gateway accepts requests from client applications and relay them to the Nym mixnet.
A Network Requester executes impersonal requests from the mixnet to endpoints.
I would like to support Nym Wallet, Electrum, Keybase, Telegram.
