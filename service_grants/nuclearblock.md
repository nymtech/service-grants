We are working with NYM technology from Finney testnet and now we want to dive dipper.
We are looking for closer cooperation with NYM as noderunner and app developer.
Gateway is the interface between users and the mixnet that check app's/user's credentials, send traffic through the mixnet and also receive or store traffic on the other end. Network Requester allows for private network requests to be made outside the mixnet from local Nym client.
If it possible, we can support all (wallet, Electrum, telegram and keybase) services.
