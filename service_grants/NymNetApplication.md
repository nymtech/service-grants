Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
Gateways (will eventually) process Coconut based bandwidth credentials to allow Nym clients to send and receive traffic across the mixnet. They also act as a mailbox of sorts, temporarily storing messages for pseudanymous clients. Network Requesters are service providers that act as proxies to an allowlist of internet addresses.
We want to maintain these nodes because we are passionate about fighting surveillance states and strengthening privacy infrastructure. We also want to show our commitment to the community, as we will be applying for research internships at Nym later this year! We operate a fairly popular mixnode already as volunteers (0% profit margin), and a grant would enable us to dedicate a bit less time to our work and more time to Nym! We'd like to support Signal, and we are currently working on a fork of Signal-Desktop to add a menu option for specifying a socks5 proxy similar to Telegram's flow.
