``Full attention only to nymtech.
``

Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
``Why?: The success of a privacy oriented technology rests on various elements put together. Ofcourse, a healthy mixnode network is important but this alone is not enough. Equally important is a network of healthy gateways that provide entry points for both the client apps and service providers. This is necessary if the target is to create a framework for privacy oriented DApps to use NYM's infrastructure. Simply put, we want to maintain these nodes to support the project into its next leap. We have been running a reliable mixnode in the mainnet since the early days of the project (and have been involved in the testnets from the early stages of the project). We have access to good servers with 100% uptime, good connectivity and large storage facilities.
We already run a nym-gateway node with identity key 2y2tLbufvn7DEkgYUckknqDwN4o3ER34YCAB7QYDnhqN
.We also already run a network-requester with address Ae74GRmyT3YEHJVPAoZEobYz9L7tona34277CJ7bHibK.Cgz4yt7w1gRMftx7CNL5SS1NegMXKGdc11HKQc4qptHv@2y2tLbufvn7DEkgYUckknqDwN4o3ER34YCAB7QYDnhqN
.We are ready to setup the gateway node and the network-requester with instructions for service_grants if we are selected for the grant.
Which? We are open to run gateways for Nym wallet, or Telegram or Keybase or all of them. With our network requester, we are open to all services and Nym clients who would like to make outbound request from our server using our network requester as long as they are included in the allowed list.
