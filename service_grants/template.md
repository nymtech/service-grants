Do you maintain nodes in other projects? 
If so, please briefly list which projects below: 
```
I currently do not maintain any nodes apart from NYM mainnet one. But earlier I ran Tor relays for a few years.

Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
In my understanding, gateways are nodes that act as an interface for the clients and servers to actually route their packets through the mix network. Depending on which end of communication the node lies, it can either send or receive packets via the mixnet. Gatewyas are a more stable component of the NYM infrastructure to which individual clients and servers can connect to. Gateways can help provide multiple features such as to facilitate access control and allow only the users who posses appropriate credentials to access the network. At the same time they can also store messages in case the user is offline, such that the user can access those messages at a later point in time, when it comes online.
Network requesters are nodes that can help the clients access application-level services within and outside of the NYM network in a privacy preserving manner. The clients can connect to these nodes and either avail a specific service being hosted on the network requester itself, or can access other popular applications available on the Internet, such as telegram and keybase by using network requester as a transparent proxy. In the latter case, the transparent proxy hides the IP address as well as the network characteristics of the clients from any third party observing the network, essentially allowing them to access these services in a surveillance resilient manner.
The reason I wish to maintain these nodes is because I already do research and have a PhD on such topics. Running these nodes will help me contribute towards a privacy supportive Internet and at the same time will allow me to closely study the technicalities of the deployed system to further increase my knowledge base. Eventually, I may be able to even pursue further research on the development of such infrastructure and may even be able to contribute towards the betterment of the project.
I would want to run the network requester service for Telegram, as I already have some development experience playing around with it's codebase. But, if required I can even run other services as well.
