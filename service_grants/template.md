```
Gateway = entrance to the NYM Mixnet, check that users have paid to use bandwith
Network requester = exit of the mixnet to privacy apps and services
Why do I want to run a Gateway/Network requester:
- Because I believe freedom of speech is fundamental for an open society
- Because I believe privacy is crucial to support this vision
- Because Governments should fear their citizens and citizen shouldn't fear their governments. 
- Because I want to fight mass surveillance which goes against all these principles
- As simple as that. Let me bring my beliefs into it
