Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
I have been running the mixnode (https://mixnet.explorers.guru/mixnode/7xwUc4k6iWK3yuBNR7CgDVEh6zo2BenKZvbUJPoPzZyb) since the mainnet launch. I have played around with the SOCKS5 client and sent a few mixed messages via telegram : ).  
For me, it doesn't matter which service to support. But if need to choose, I will choose Telegram because I'm a regular user of the messenger. 
Would be super cool for me if telegram users will use my infrastructure to increase their privacy on a new level!
