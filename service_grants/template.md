Do you maintain nodes in other projects?
If so, please briefly list which projects below:
```
Today, we run validators in many PoS blockchains. Our validators are active on Tendermint-based mainnets (Akash, Asset Mantle, Bitcanna, Certik, Chihuahua, Cerberus, Comdex, Cosmos Hub, Crescent, Evmos, Fetch, Gravity Bridge, Galaxy, Injective, Juno, Kava, Kichain, Konstellation, Meme, Nomic, Nym, Osmosis, Sifchain, Sommelier, Stargaze, and Umee) and Substrate-based mainnets (Polkadot, Kusama, and Polkadex). Overall, delegators/nominators have trusted us with close to $100M in crypto assets. You can find more information about us on our website (https://polkachu.com).

To support the blockchain communities, we also run IBC relayers for the Cosmos ecosystem at our own cost. Currently, we have two relayer hubs. The Juno Relayer Hub supports two-way channels between Juno and Bitcanna, Chihuahua, Sifchain. Our Osmosis Relayer Hub supports two way channels between Osmosis and Bitcanna, Chihuahua and Konstellation. See https://polkachu.com/relayers.

We actively participate in the on-chain governance (see https://polkachu.com/gov_votes), engage with the community on Discord, and run testnet/devnet nodes when needed. We try our best to be a good community member in addition to providing the validation service.

Most importantly, we open-source our deployment scripts and provide community tools for validators and delegators alike.

Our open-source scripts include:

Polkadot/Kusama Node Deployment Script (https://github.com/polkachu/polkadot-validator)
Other Substrate-Based Node Deployment Script (https://github.com/polkachu/substrate-validator)
Tendermint-Based Node Deployment Script (https://github.com/polkachu/cosmos-validators)
Monitoring Server Deployment Script (https://github.com/polkachu/server-monitoring)
Secure Server Setup for Validator (https://github.com/polkachu/secure-server-setup)
Our community tools include:

Polkadot/Kusama Payout Guard (https://polkachu.com/payout_guard)
Polkadot/Kusama/Polkadex Universal Scout (https://polkachu.com/scout)
Kusama/Polkadot Snapshots (https://polkachu.com/snapshots)
Tendermint-Based Chains Snapshots (https://polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots)
Polkadot/Kusama Validator Resource Site on Gitbook (https://github.com/polkachu/validator-resources)
```

Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? *
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below:
```
Gateway is the first hop into the mixnet, and Requester is the hop out into user app.

We already run a gateway. Identity key: 3SmkGWoCMV37w3VfqTYKXDNAxGBji1xX2EfaoDC6jxWQ

We also run a mixnode. Identity key: 5S43vat8YfdqWHJnMyeNv3xfoXX9yUmk1vGTyxvoYc19

We will add Nym Wallet Network Requester.
