#### Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 

Network requester allows a Nym user to be able to make outbound requests from the server on which is hosted, controlled by allowlists (or as an open proxy, if required). 

We have been supporting Nym from the early testnets and would love to continue running additional infrastructure to help decentralise the Network Requester and Gateway set. We are willing to support Nym Wallet, Electrum, Telegram and Keybase.

We additionally propose the following: 

- Running a Signal Network Requester + Gateway for additional privacy in Signal (Signal has support for proxies as outlined [here](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/1430#issuecomment-534082505))
- Open Relay with firewall rules which mimick the [Reduced Exit Policy](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/ReducedExitPolicy) of Tor
