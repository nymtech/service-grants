```
Gateways provide a destination for mixnet packets. Gateways acts as a destination, sort of like a mailbox, for messages. Clients connect to gateways and messages are automatically piped to connected clients and deleted from the gateway's disk storage after complete. Network Requester allows users to make outbound network requests from him server. i want to study and be one of those who develop private internet. So I want to support Nym Wallet gateway+network requester.
