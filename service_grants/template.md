Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
Gateways provide a destination for mixnet packets. Most of the internet doesn't use encrypted Sphinx packets, so the gateway acts as a destination, sort of like a mailbox, for messages.

Nym clients connect to gateways. Messages are automatically piped to connected clients and deleted from the gateway's disk storage. If a client is offline when a message arrives, it will be stored for later retrieval. When the client connects, all messages will be delivered, and deleted from the gateway's disk.

We have been an avid supporter of  Nym since begining 2.5 years ago because of the nature of the problem they are trying to solve. we would lve to get involved.

we would like to run all 4 services.
