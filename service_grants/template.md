To help the NymTech team to perform various test (stress test, metric data collection and analysis etc.) of the use of gateways and network requesters with some real work scenarios (and not just simulations) so that the next step in the evolvement of NYM technologies takes its shape. By running a gateway and network requester, we will be contributing in the establishment of a infrastructure where vaious client Apps and services can make use of privacy oriented Nym technologies.
We can run service for signal app, but we are also open to run service for telegram, nym wallet, keybase, different crypto wallets etc.
