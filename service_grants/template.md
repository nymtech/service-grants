```
I'd like the idea of NYM. I think NYM vision of using cc is more clother, than etherium or solana. It should be more anonimous and more 'mixed'. I wish to maintain these node for the idea of NYM. I am buying and staking NYM with NGexplorer because I like the team, the idea, I was seeng NYM in Paris and that the Snowden supports you - it does matter! So if I am "so in" in the project, why I shouldnt wish to maintain a node to support what I am really like?
I would like to apply on Keybase gateway+network requester or Nym Wallet gateway+network requester
