Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
Gateways - are the interface between users and the mixnet. They check that an application or user has the credentials to use the mixnet.
Network Requesters - are the hop out that takes the user from the exit gateway to an app â€” which they are now using in a privacy-enhanced mode.
I want to help the project achieve its goal faster and better. My experience makes it possible
