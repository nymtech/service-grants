Start of the this year I tried to run a node but unfortunately i missed the chance, now i am very much hopeful and excited to be part of community.
```

Do you maintain nodes in other projects? 
If so, please briefly list which projects below: 
```
xxnetwork, Forta, Ironfish, Idep
```

Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
Gateways are interface between users and mixnet, basically they are entry point to mixnet, they can also offer privacy features, furthermore they do thigns like checking credentials, sending/receiving messages, if user is offline then they store the message and relay them forward once user gets online.

Network Requesters are the hop out that takes the user from the exit gateway to the app.

I am a privacy adovcate, and a big fan of David Chaum and how Nym is implementing it is awesome, i would be really happy to be part of project.

Regarding service, well i might run wallet and/or Telegram service.
