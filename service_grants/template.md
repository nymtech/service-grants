I am not on any of these apps. About four paragraphs down you'll go "oh, IRC. Figures."

But sure, I'll use other apps if there's a common interest. I would prefer Telegram.

```
A small and unimportant IRC cluster with associated services.

We retired a VPS node that is sitting around doing nothing , and yet it is nonetheless paid until 2024 or so.

If you don't like VPS providers for.. well, obvious reasons .. and prefer "home grown operators" to run this sort of thing with custody of the server, I have fiber and can do that as well on a modest and reasonably reliable system I have here.

Jurisdictions for the aforementioned : Poland for the VPS. Mexico for the home lap.
```

Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
My background is in US telecommunications and trading platforms. I'm retired and just saw myself out of another project after 12 years. I am looking for something interesting to do to keep my mind and my skillset sharpened. 

I'm not a coiner but I have done some experimentation with monerod, p2pool, bitcoin core (just to "see how it works") and have recently been familiarizing myself with some web3 ecosystems such as Cosmos. I'm not "all in" on a particular platform I'm just looking down the road right now.

I only learned about Nym yesterday and it's the sort of thing I would have downloaded and cheerfully ran a node for free for experimentation purposes -- but I came across the requirement to collateralize some "nym" crypto in order to participate ... and here we are.
