Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
How I understand, gateway serves as destination for mixnet packets and traffic goes throw next route - user -> nym-client -> gateway 1 -> mixnode 1 -> mixnode 2 -> mixnode 3 -> ... -> gateway 2 -> nym-client -> service. So the the user's traffic is anonimous. I like the idea of privacy? want to help testing new technology. I would like to support Telegram gateway+network requester or Nym Wallet gateway+network requester.
