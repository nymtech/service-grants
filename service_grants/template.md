Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
I want to be part of the development of privacy on the Internet. Privacy is very important to individuals and society.
Gateways are message storage for network clients. When clients connect to a gateway, they get messages intended for them. After the client has received the messages, they will be deleted from the gateway's repository.
The Network Requester is the layer between the NYM network client and the service the Network Requester provides. This increases the privacy of the network. The Network Requester also determines which services to access through its node. I want to support Nym Wallet service and Telegram. I am an active mixnode holder and want to support the NYM network.
