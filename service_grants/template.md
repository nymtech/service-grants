I used to be a community manager in the swarm (bzz) project and run a node, and I built a node for Aleo (pow mining project)
```

Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 

```
For the nym hybrid network, I am very happy to open to a real demand scenario, nym changes the phenomenon that the onion browser's network speed is very slow, and may replace it.

The gateway is like a springboard independent of the nym mixnode, it detects user credentials and requests
Network requester: similar to the data encryption front end, and undertakes part of the data url request audit work

If there is something wrong with my understanding, please forgive me.
