Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
As I understand, the first hop through which the user has to go through to get to the application - Gateways and Network Requesters are the last one. So the traffic has the next route:
user - gateway - mixnode 1 - mixnode 2 - â€¦ - Network Requesters - application.
The reason I wish to maintain these nodes is because I want to help with testing of new technology.
I would like to support - Keybase, Nym Wallet, Electrum Wallet, Telegram.
