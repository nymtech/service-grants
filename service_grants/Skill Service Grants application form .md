Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
Gateways serve as a message store for clients who can disconnect and reconnect to the network, and also protect against denial of service attacks. Network Requester is a proxy that contains URLs used by Block stream Green and Electrum cryptographic wallets. But it can be changed using the URLs of the web services to which it will connect. I participated in the testnet, I liked the project, the project team that always helps. I'm interested in the technology and what you want to create. I keep the mixnode in testnet and mainet. I am very interested in launching Gateway and Network Requester! If you give me this opportunity, I will be grateful to you!
