```
I was maintaining nodes and validating testnets for some prominent projects, among them are: Solana, Moonbeam, Casper, Meter, Hopr, Clover, NYM, Axelar, Archway. Doing this for 2 years already.

I can provide some nodes running right now:
Solana mainnet https://www.validators.app/validators/A8vNkfP4Rv6msJyuXgwvUSUUu5vPfLxMJB5ddNkHaCGJ?network=mainnet
Casper testnet https://testnet.cspr.live/validator/018d78dfb68f4edc0d654768fe8f2d84e6b244de7664e0a30ece3c438fd0747f30
```

Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
It`s the way to help fighting for future where privacy protection exsist while get compensated for used time. I think its win-win opportunity.

To answer simple about nodes: gateways are entry points to the Nym mixnet while Network Requester is an exit point :)
