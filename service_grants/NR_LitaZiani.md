```
I want as i wanted and did to b epart of the privacy layer of teh internet of the future. I personally think peopel have been aggregated to be handled and get programmed for what ever to be sold, when they traded off their peer to peer connectinivty and accepted to be treated as a point in a set. There is no peer to peer if it is not truely between only and only between those two parties.
Network requester allows Nym users to make outbound network requests from your server and gateways provides a destination for mixnet packets.
