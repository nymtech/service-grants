Why do you want to run a Gateway and Network Requester? * 
Please briefly describe what these nodes do, why you wish to maintain these nodes, and which service you would like to support with your Network Requester below: 
```
A Gateway provides access to user to mixnet and checks its credentials for possibility to use mixnet, meanwhile makes query to blockchain. Traffic moves through gateway to mixnet and it can store traffic if receiver is offline.
Requester sends request of a message from mixnet and sends it to a certain endpoint, without any data about an user.
I really like idea about privacy, particularly what NYM does. Participating from start of the project is very interesting. I have run a mixnode more that one year and i didn't dump any NYM tokens, because for me it haven't just speculative cryptoproject. Finally, i have just like to run with infrastructure and maintain it.
